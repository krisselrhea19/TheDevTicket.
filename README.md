# DevRev Smart Ticket Tagging System

## Project Overview
The **DevRev Smart Ticket Tagging System** is a tool designed to automatically categorize and assign relevant tags to support tickets, streamlining the support process and enabling faster issue resolution. The system leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the content of support tickets and intelligently assign relevant tags. These tags help support teams categorize issues, prioritize workflows, and improve the overall efficiency of the support team.

## Objective
The main objective of this system is to reduce the manual effort required for tagging support tickets, enabling quicker ticket routing, better tracking, and a more organized ticketing process. It will allow DevRev’s customer support and technical teams to focus on resolving issues rather than categorizing tickets.

## Key Features

### 1. Automated Tagging
- NLP-based text analysis for identifying keywords, phrases, and entities in ticket descriptions.
- Automatic generation of relevant tags based on predefined categories (e.g., "Bug", "Feature Request", "Performance Issue", etc.).

### 2. Custom Tagging Models
- Support for creating custom tags specific to a company’s workflow or ticketing system.
- Ability to fine-tune and improve the accuracy of tags over time with feedback.

### 3. Machine Learning Integration
- Continual improvement of tagging accuracy using machine learning models that adapt based on the ticket data over time.
- Integration with existing ticketing systems like Jira, Zendesk, etc., for seamless tagging automation.

### 4. Real-time Ticket Analysis
- The system can analyze incoming tickets in real-time, applying relevant tags immediately upon ticket creation.
- Provides immediate visibility to support agents on ticket type and complexity, improving prioritization.

### 5. Tagging Dashboard
- A centralized dashboard to view all tags in use, monitor tag performance, and fine-tune tag assignment rules.
- Statistical insights into ticket trends, most frequent tags, and areas of concern.

### 6. Integration with Support Systems
- Easy integration with popular support systems such as Jira, Zendesk, and ServiceNow.
- APIs to fetch, tag, and send tickets to other integrated systems.
